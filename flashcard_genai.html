        question: "What does NLP stand for in AI?",
        answer: "Natural Language Processing",
        tip: "NLP helps machines understand human language—used in chatbots and sentiment analysis."
      },
      {
        question: "What is prompt engineering?",
        answer: "Designing inputs to get the best outputs from a generative AI model.",
        tip: "It's like crafting the perfect question to get a helpful answer."
      },
      {
        question: "What is a hallucination in AI?",
        answer: "When a model gives a false or made-up response.",
        tip: "These are confident but incorrect answers, watch out for them in GenAI tools."
      },
      {
        question: "What does 'fine-tuning' a model mean?",
        answer: "Adjusting a pre-trained model to perform better on a specific task.",
        tip: "Used to specialize models for industries like healthcare or law."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the purpose of a tokenizer in NLP?",
        answer: "To break down text into smaller pieces (tokens) for processing.",
        tip: "Tokens can be words, characters, or subwords—essential for understanding language."
      },
      {
        question: "What is transfer learning in AI?",
        answer: "Using knowledge from one task to improve performance on another related task.",
        tip: "It allows models to leverage existing data and learn faster."
      },
      {
        question: "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?",
        answer: "A type of AI trained on vast text datasets to understand and generate human-like language.",
        tip: "Examples include GPT, BERT, and PaLM."
      },
      {
        question: "What is Generative AI primarily used for?",
        answer: "Creating new content such as text, images, audio, and code.",
        tip: "Generative AI is designed to generate data that resembles its training set."
    },
    {
        question: "What does 'fine-tuning' mean in the context of AI models?",
        answer: "Adjusting a pre-trained model on a smaller, specific dataset to improve its performance on a particular task.",
        tip: "Fine-tuning helps models specialize beyond general-purpose training."
    },
    {
        question: "Which model architecture is widely used in modern generative AI tools like ChatGPT?",
        answer: "Transformer",
        tip: "Transformers use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of input data."
    },
    {
        question: "What is 'prompt engineering'?",
        answer: "Crafting inputs to guide a language model\u2019s output effectively.",
        tip: "The quality of your prompt heavily influences the model\u2019s response."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a major ethical concern in generative AI?",
        answer: "Misinformation and deepfakes.",
        tip: "Generated content can be misused to spread false or misleading information."
    },
    {
        question: "How does generative AI differ from traditional AI?",
        answer: "Generative AI creates new content, whereas traditional AI focuses on predictions and classifications.",
        tip: "Generative AI outputs new data; traditional AI interprets existing data."
    },
    {
        question: "Which type of generative model can create images from text prompts?",
        answer: "Diffusion models (e.g., DALL\u00b7E, Stable Diffusion).",
        tip: "These models translate text into pixel-by-pixel images."
    },
    {
        question: "What is zero-shot learning in AI?",
        answer: "The model performs tasks without any specific training examples for that task.",
        tip: "Language models like GPT-4 demonstrate zero-shot capabilities."
    },
    {
        question: "What does 'token' mean in language models?",
        answer: "A piece of text, often a word or part of a word, used as a unit of input for the model.",
        tip: "Models process and generate content one token at a time."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is data quality important in training AI models?",
        answer: "Poor-quality data can lead to biased or inaccurate outputs.",
        tip: "The output is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on\u2014garbage in, garbage out."
